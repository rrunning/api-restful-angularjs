  <div id="christmas-story" class="stories">
		<p>Every Christmas we {{ $ctrl.Words.userWords.verbs[0] }} to a {{ $ctrl.adjectives[0] }} tree farm far away. This is not just any {{ $ctrl.adjectives[1] }} tree farm. My dad and I {{ $ctrl.verbs[1] }} onto the {{ $ctrl.nouns[0] }} to {{ $ctrl.verbs[2] }} for the perfect {{ $ctrl.nouns[1] }}. Some people like them {{ $ctrl.adjectives[2] }}, but I prefer them {{ $ctrl.adjectives[3] }}. After searching for hours I usually {{ $ctrl.adverbs[0] }} exclaim "Dad! The perfect tree is over there!" Off we {{ $ctrl.verbs[3] }} to get the tree. The problem is we always forget the {{ $ctrl.nouns[2] }} and the {{ $ctrl.nouns[3] }}. But at the end of the day we {{ $ctrl.adverbs[1] }} get the tree and head home {{ $ctrl.adverbs[2] }}. "I wish it was Christmas all year round" I {{ $ctrl.adverbs[3] }} think to myself.</p>

  <div id='shopping-story' class="stories">
    <p>Today I went shopping. When I arrived at the store I saw a {{ $ctrl.adjectives[0] }} {{ $ctrl.nouns[0] }}, who upon noticing me {{ $ctrl.adverbs[0] }} said "I need to {{ $ctrl.verbs[0] }}". "Well, that was {{ $ctrl.adjectives[1] }}" I thought to myself and walked in the store. The store had rearranged it's inventory, so I felt {{ $ctrl.adverbs[1] }} lost. I walked up to store clerk and said {{ $ctrl.adverbs[2] }} "I am looking for a {{ $ctrl.adjectives[2] }} {{ $ctrl.nouns[1] }} that doesn't {{ $ctrl.verbs[1] }} as often as the last one I had." The store clerk looked at me with a {{ $ctrl.adjectives[3] }} look in his eye and said, "What you are looking for can be found by the {{ $ctrl.nouns[2] }}, if you see a {{ $ctrl.nouns[3] }} that {{ $ctrl.adverbs[3] }} can {{ $ctrl.verbs[2] }}, then you've gone too far." As I tried to understand his directions, I thought to myself, "I should have just ordered it on amazon.com, Their products seem to {{ $ctrl.verbs[3] }} the perfect amount".</p>

  <div id='brainstorming-story' class="stories">
    <p>Many say that brainstorming is {{ $ctrl.adjectives[0] }} and does not {{ $ctrl.verbs[0] }}. However, with the combination of the right computer and {{ $ctrl.nouns[0] }} anyone can lead a good {{ $ctrl.verbs[1] }}. When you have {{ $ctrl.adverbs[0] }} pulled together a {{ $ctrl.adjectives[1] }} group of {{ $ctrl.nouns[1] }} in a big room with lots of TV's then magical things will happen. In the past we have {{ $ctrl.adverbs[1] }} suggested participants work together to find the most {{ $ctrl.adjectives[2] }} solution. The most difficult part is many {{ $ctrl.adjectives[3] }} {{ $ctrl.nouns[2] }} like to {{ $ctrl.verbs[2] }}. This has proved to be {{ $ctrl.adverbs[2] }} problematic. But in the end the most important {{ $ctrl.nouns[3] }} usually is brought to light. Typically we try to encourage ideas to {{ $ctrl.verbs[3] }}, and never shut ideas down. This concludes our instructions. Thanks for {{ $ctrl.adverbs[3] }} listening!</p>
